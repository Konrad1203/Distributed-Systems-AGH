Distributed Programming with GRPC

gRPC is a modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems.

Why would I want to use gRPC? The main usage scenarios:

- Low latency, highly scalable, distributed systems.
- Developing mobile clients which are communicating to a cloud server.
- Designing a new protocol that needs to be accurate, efficient and language independent.
- Layered design to enable extension eg. authentication, load balancing, logging and monitoring etc.

What does gRPC stand for? gRPC Remote Procedure Calls, of course!
